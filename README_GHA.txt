How to use this repository to build the plugin with GitHub Actions (Windows runner)

1) Create a new GitHub repository and push these files to the repo root.
2) Ensure default branch is 'main'.
3) Go to GitHub â†’ Actions, open 'Build BrushPlugin (Windows)' and run it or push to main to trigger.
4) After a successful run, download the artifact named 'BrushPlugin-build'.
   Inside the artifact you'll find the compiled DLL in bin\Release.
5) Copy the compiled DLL to:
   C:\Program Files\paint.net\Effects\
   (Admin rights required.)
6) Restart Paint.NET.

Notes:
- The scaffold compiles without Paint.NET assemblies because it doesn't call Paint.NET APIs directly.
- If you modify the project to reference Paint.NET assemblies, you'll need to include them in the repo or otherwise supply them at build time.
