Paint.NET Plugin Ready Project with Synthetic Brushes - BrushPluginExample

Contents:
- BrushPlugin.csproj         : Visual Studio project (targets .NET Framework 4.8)
- BrushLoader.cs            : Helper to load embedded brush images
- BrushPlugin.cs            : Skeleton showing how to access loaded brushes (NOT a complete Paint.NET plugin)
- Resources/                : Contains the synthetic brush image files (embedded as resources in the project)

How to build:
1) Open the BrushPluginExample folder in Visual Studio (2019/2022) or your preferred .NET dev environment.
2) Ensure .NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack is installed.
3) Add references to the Paint.NET assemblies matching your installed Paint.NET version (usually in C:\Program Files\paint.net\).
   Typical assemblies: PaintDotNet.Base.dll, PaintDotNet.Core.dll, PaintDotNet.Effects.dll, PaintDotNet.dll
4) Implement or adapt the plugin classes per the Paint.NET plugin SDK, using the brushes loaded by BrushLoader.
5) Build in Release mode. The resulting DLL will be in bin/Release and can be copied into Paint.NET's Effects (or appropriate plugin) folder.

If you want the images resized/centered to a particular stamp size (e.g., 512x512) before embedding, say "resize" and I'll regenerate.
